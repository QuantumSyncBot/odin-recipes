    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Even though Dalgona coffee is a very recent trend online, it is not a new drink. It is a South Korean interpretation of a whipped coffee drink that has been around for a while (there are plenty of posts with recipe from before 2020). You’ll find recipes for whipped instant coffee, beaten coffee or Indian coffee that are the same thing.</p>
    <p>So why is this Dalgona coffee? Dalgona is a Korean candy. It is made by caramelizing sugar and mixing in some baking soda. It is quite similar to honeycomb, however, contains less baking soda, so it’s slightly less puffy. The colour of Dalgona candy is a light brown cream colour, exactly the colour of Dalgona colour, hence the name association.</p>

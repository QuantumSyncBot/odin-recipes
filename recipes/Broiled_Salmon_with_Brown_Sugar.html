    <h1>Broiled Salmon with Brown Sugar</h1>
    <img src="../pictures/broiled_salmon.jpeg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite broiled salmon with brown sugar recipes.</p>
    <p>Baking salmon takes longer than broiling and has a tendency to overcook making it dry. Broiled Salmon – Broiled is when it's cooked directly from the heating element on top of the oven, roasting it until light brown. It cooks rather quickly, and the browning of the salmon helps intensify the delicious flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, cut into 1/4-inch thick wedge</li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless salmon fillets</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar and soy sauce in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion, salt, and pepper in the hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to sugar mixture and mix together. Place salmon fillets on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cook salmon in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Turn over and drizzle with 1/2 of the sugar mixture. Continue to broil until salmon is opaque throughout and easily flaked with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes more. Serve with remaining sugar mixture.</li>
    </ol>
